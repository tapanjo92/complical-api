## Key Architecture Decisions

### Technology Stack (LOCKED IN)
- **Infrastructure:** AWS CDK with TypeScript
- **Backend:** TypeScript/Node.js 20.x Lambda functions
- **Frontend:** Next.js 14 with Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- **Database:** DynamoDB with GSIs for efficient querying
- **Authentication:** AWS Cognito (User Pools + Identity Pools)
- **Scraping:** Playwright + Cheerio

### AWS Services (CONFIRMED)
- API Gateway REST (not HTTP API) for usage plans
- Lambda with Node.js runtime
- DynamoDB with on-demand billing
- Cognito for M2M OAuth 2.0 authentication
- Step Functions for scraping orchestration
- CloudFront for API caching
- X-Ray for distributed tracing
- WAF for security

### Project Structure
```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ infrastructure/     # CDK TypeScript
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backend/           # Lambda functions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ frontend/          # Next.js developer portal
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ shared/            # Shared types
```

### Key URLs to Scrape
- ATO: https://www.ato.gov.au/tax-and-super-professionals/lodgment-program/important-dates
- IRD: https://www.ird.govt.nz/key-dates
- ASIC: https://asic.gov.au/for-business/running-a-company/annual-statements/

### Critical Implementation Notes
1. Phase 0 (Legal/Market validation) must happen first
2. MVP timeline: 3-4 months (not 1-2)
3. E&O insurance required before launch
4. Implement billing in Phase 1, not Phase 2
5. All data must include source attribution
6. Strong disclaimers about data accuracy

### Testing Commands
```bash
npm test                    # Run all tests
cd infrastructure && cdk diff  # Check infrastructure changes
cd backend && npm run test     # Backend unit tests
```

### Deployment
```bash
cd infrastructure
npm run cdk deploy --all
```

### API Testing
```bash
# Health check (no auth)

- Cognito Client ID: 64pq56h3al1l1r7ehfhflgujib
- DynamoDB Table: complical-deadlines-dev

## Frontend Deployment (2025-06-26)
- **Deployment Method**: CloudFront + S3 (static export)
- **CloudFront URL**: https://d2xoxkdqlbm2pj.cloudfront.net
- **S3 Buckets**: 
  - Frontend: `complical-frontend-dev-809555764832`
  - Logs: `complical-frontend-logs-dev-809555764832`
- **CloudFront Logging**: Enabled to S3 bucket with 30-day retention
- **Status**: üîÑ UPDATING (fixing 403 error with S3Origin configuration)

### Frontend Configuration
- Next.js 14 with static export (`output: 'export'`)
- CloudFront Origin Access Identity (OAI) for S3 access
- Error pages redirect to index.html for client-side routing
- Configuration loaded from `/config.js` at runtime

### Recent Issues & Fixes
1. **Amplify Deployment**: Initially attempted, removed per user request
2. **403 Forbidden**: Fixed by updating S3Origin with OAI configuration
3. **CloudFront Logging**: Fixed ACL issues with proper bucket policy
4. **API Key Authorization (2025-06-26)**: 
   - Issue: API keys returned 403 Forbidden even when valid
   - Root cause: Keys weren't associated with usage plans due to CDK circular dependency
   - Solution: Store usage plan ID in SSM Parameter Store, Lambda reads it to associate keys
   - Script created: `/scripts/associate-api-keys.sh` to associate existing keys
5. **Rate Limiting**: 
   - Configured: 10 req/sec rate limit, 20 req burst, 10k/month quota
   - All API keys now properly associated with free tier usage plan
6. **User Authentication Flow**:
   - Traditional email/password registration via Cognito
   - JWT tokens for dashboard access (1 hour expiry)
   - API keys for API access (no expiry unless manually revoked)

## Latest Updates (2025-06-26 Evening)

### Pagination Implementation
- Added pagination support to deadlines API endpoints
- Query parameter `nextToken` for continuing result sets
- Base64-encoded pagination tokens for security
- Works for both AU and NZ jurisdictions
- Tested and working with `?limit=X&nextToken=Y` parameters

### Real Compliance Data Loaded
- **Australia (12 deadlines)**: BAS Quarterly/Monthly, PAYG Withholding, Super Guarantee, Income Tax, FBT
- **New Zealand (9 deadlines)**: GST Monthly/2-Monthly, PAYE, Provisional Tax, IR3, FBT Quarterly, KiwiSaver
- Data sourced from official government websites (ATO and IRD)
- Script: `/packages/infrastructure/scripts/load-real-deadlines.js`

### Security Testing Progress
‚úÖ **Authentication & Authorization**
- API requires valid API key (403 without key)
- Protected endpoints require JWT token (401 without auth)
- Invalid credentials properly rejected

‚úÖ **Injection Vulnerabilities**
- NoSQL injection attempts blocked by input validation
- SQL injection attempts rejected with 400 errors
- Path traversal in nextToken parameter prevented
- Malformed JSON in registration rejected

‚úÖ **Security Headers**
- All security headers properly configured:
  - Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)
  - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
  - X-Frame-Options: DENY
  - X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
  - Content-Security-Policy
  - Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
- CORS restricted to allowed origins only

‚úÖ **Rate Limiting (Partial)**
- Usage plans configured: 10 req/s, burst 20, 10k/month
- Testing shows very permissive limits (needs investigation)
- All API keys associated with free tier plan

### Pending Security Tests
- [ ] Cryptographic implementations review
- [ ] Input validation edge cases
- [ ] API key security (rotation, storage)
- [ ] Infrastructure security (IAM policies, network isolation)

### API Endpoints
- **Australia**: `/v1/au/ato/deadlines`
- **New Zealand**: `/v1/nz/ird/deadlines`
- Both support: `type`, `from_date`, `to_date`, `limit`, `nextToken`

### Testing Commands
```bash
# Test with pagination
curl -X GET "https://lyd1qoxc01.execute-api.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/dev/v1/au/ato/deadlines?limit=3" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"

# Test NZ endpoints
curl -X GET "https://lyd1qoxc01.execute-api.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/dev/v1/nz/ird/deadlines" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```
