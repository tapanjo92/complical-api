## Key Architecture Decisions

### Technology Stack (LOCKED IN)
- **Infrastructure:** AWS CDK with TypeScript
- **Backend:** TypeScript/Node.js 20.x Lambda functions
- **Frontend:** Next.js 14 with Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- **Database:** DynamoDB with GSIs for efficient querying
- **Authentication:** AWS Cognito (User Pools + Identity Pools)
- **Scraping:** Playwright + Cheerio

### AWS Services (CONFIRMED)
- API Gateway REST (not HTTP API) for usage plans
- Lambda with Node.js runtime
- DynamoDB with on-demand billing
- Cognito for M2M OAuth 2.0 authentication
- Step Functions for scraping orchestration
- CloudFront for API caching
- X-Ray for distributed tracing
- WAF for security

### Project Structure
```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ infrastructure/     # CDK TypeScript
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backend/           # Lambda functions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ frontend/          # Next.js developer portal
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ shared/            # Shared types
```

### Key URLs to Scrape
- ATO: https://www.ato.gov.au/tax-and-super-professionals/lodgment-program/important-dates
- IRD: https://www.ird.govt.nz/key-dates
- ASIC: https://asic.gov.au/for-business/running-a-company/annual-statements/

### Critical Implementation Notes
1. Phase 0 (Legal/Market validation) must happen first
2. MVP timeline: 3-4 months (not 1-2)
3. E&O insurance required before launch
4. Implement billing in Phase 1, not Phase 2
5. All data must include source attribution
6. Strong disclaimers about data accuracy

### Testing Commands
```bash
npm test                    # Run all tests

## Frontend Deployment (2025-06-26)
- **Deployment Method**: CloudFront + S3 (static export)
- **CloudFront URL**: https://d2xoxkdqlbm2pj.cloudfront.net
- **S3 Buckets**: 
  - Frontend: `complical-frontend-dev-809555764832`
  - Logs: `complical-frontend-logs-dev-809555764832`
- **CloudFront Logging**: Enabled to S3 bucket with 30-day retention
- **Status**: üîÑ UPDATING (fixing 403 error with S3Origin configuration)

### Frontend Configuration
- Next.js 14 with static export (`output: 'export'`)
- CloudFront Origin Access Identity (OAI) for S3 access
- Error pages redirect to index.html for client-side routing
- Configuration loaded from `/config.js` at runtime

### Recent Issues & Fixes
1. **Amplify Deployment**: Initially attempted, removed per user request
2. **403 Forbidden**: Fixed by updating S3Origin with OAI configuration
3. **CloudFront Logging**: Fixed ACL issues with proper bucket policy
4. **API Key Authorization (2025-06-26)**: 
   - Issue: API keys returned 403 Forbidden even when valid
   - Root cause: Keys weren't associated with usage plans due to CDK circular dependency
   - Solution: Store usage plan ID in SSM Parameter Store, Lambda reads it to associate keys
   - Script created: `/scripts/associate-api-keys.sh` to associate existing keys
5. **Rate Limiting**: 
   - Configured: 10 req/sec rate limit, 20 req burst, 10k/month quota
   - All API keys now properly associated with free tier usage plan
6. **User Authentication Flow**:
   - Traditional email/password registration via Cognito
   - JWT tokens for dashboard access (1 hour expiry)
   - API keys for API access (no expiry unless manually revoked)
7. **Security Improvements (2025-06-27)**:
   - Implemented httpOnly cookies for JWT storage (no more localStorage)
   - Added SHA-256 hashing for API keys before storage
   - Implemented CSRF token protection for state-changing operations
   - Created custom authorizer for API key validation
8. **Native AWS Solution (2025-06-27)**:
   - Replaced synchronous usage tracking with async CloudWatch Logs processing
   - Enabled DynamoDB TTL for automatic API key expiration
   - Created optimized read-only authorizer with 5-minute caching
   - Implemented API Gateway Access Logging with custom format
   - Created usage processor Lambda with subscription filter
   - Fixed DynamoDB marshalling issues with sets
   - Zero impact on API latency with full usage tracking

### Latest Session Update (2025-06-27)

#### Native AWS Solution Implementation ‚úÖ
Successfully implemented a native AWS solution for API key management and usage tracking:

**Architecture Components:**
1. **DynamoDB TTL**: Automatic API key expiration after 90 days
2. **Optimized Read-Only Authorizer**: No write operations in API path
3. **API Gateway Access Logging**: Custom JSON format with authorizer context
4. **Async Usage Processing Lambda**: Processes logs via CloudWatch subscription
5. **Usage Metrics Table**: Stores detailed usage and hourly aggregates

**Key Benefits:**
- **Performance**: No synchronous DynamoDB writes impacting API latency
- **Cost**: Reduced DynamoDB operations with 5-minute authorizer cache
- **Scalability**: Can handle millions of requests without bottlenecks
- **Reliability**: Decoupled architecture with automatic retries

**Implementation Files:**

    "lastUsed": "2025-06-27T09:25:39.000Z"
  },
  "hourlyAggregate": {
    "requests": "1",
    "successfulRequests": "1",
    "apiKeys": ["b2zhtgopf1"]
  }
}
