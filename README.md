# CompliCal API

**A trusted, developer-first API for government and compliance deadlines.**

> ðŸŽ¯ **438 compliance deadlines** | ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º **429 Australian** | ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¿ **9 New Zealand** | âš¡ **Sub-second response**

## 1. The Core Problem

Businesses operate in a complex regulatory environment. They are required to meet hundreds of different deadlines for tax filings, license renewals, and other compliance obligations set by various government agencies. This information is critical but is often:

*   **Scattered** across dozens of non-standardized government websites.
*   **Presented** in non-machine-readable formats like PDFs and HTML tables.
*   **Subject to change** with little notice.

Failing to meet these deadlines results in direct financial penalties and significant business risk. Manually tracking this data is inefficient, error-prone, and does not scale.

## 2. The Solution: CompliCal

CompliCal solves this problem by providing a single, unified, and reliable source of truth for compliance deadlines, delivered via a clean and predictable REST API.

We handle the painful, ongoing work of sourcing, verifying, and maintaining this data, allowing developers and businesses to focus on their core products. We are a data-as-a-product company, and our product is trust.
